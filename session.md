## 🎯 **Next Session Objectives - Monitoring-First Approach**

### **Immediate Priority: Monitoring Stack (Week 1-2)**

#### **Critical Healthcare Safety Requirements**
- [ ] **Prometheus Metrics Collection** - Real-time model performance tracking
- [ ] **Grafana Dashboards** - Healthcare-specific visualizations  
- [ ] **Alertmanager Setup** - Crisis detection <99% alerts
- [ ] **Healthcare Safety Monitoring** - Response time, accuracy, empathy scores

#### **Foundation for Story 8.4**
- [ ] **Model Performance Alerts** - Automated retirement triggers
- [ ] **A/B Testing Safety Gates** - Experiment monitoring
- [ ] **Real-time Deployment Status** - Lineage dashboard requirements

### **Then: Story 8.4 Implementation (Week 3-4)**

#### **With Monitoring Foundation in Place**
- [ ] **A/B Testing Framework** - Safe model comparison with real-time alerts
- [ ] **Automated Model Retirement** - Monitoring-triggered lifecycle management
- [ ] **Model Lineage Dashboard** - Real-time deployment status tracking
