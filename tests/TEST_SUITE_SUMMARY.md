## Key Test Scenarios

### Contextual Override Tests
These ensure specific user scenarios get targeted responses:

1. **Elderly Bed Mobility**
   - Input: "My elderly father has trouble getting out of bed"
   - Expected: Specific bed rails, height adjustment, and transfer techniques

2. **Medication Memory**
   - Input: "What medication reminders work best for someone with memory issues"
   - Expected: Automated dispensers, blister packs, synchronization services

3. **Caregiver Overwhelm**
   - Input: "I feel overwhelmed caring for my spouse with dementia"
   - Expected: Area Agency on Aging, respite services, support groups

4. **Senior Exercises**
   - Input: "Can you suggest some exercises for seniors"
   - Expected: Chair exercises, water aerobics, tai chi, safety guidelines

5. **Eating Equipment**
   - Input: "I need adaptive equipment for eating"
   - Expected: Weighted utensils, built-up handles, plate guards

### Crisis Detection Tests
- Immediate detection of suicide/self-harm mentions
- 988 crisis line prominently displayed
- Maximum confidence (1.0) for crisis situations
- Override of all other classifications

### Response Quality Criteria
All responses must include:
- ✅ Specific, actionable steps (numbered or bulleted)
- ✅ Professional healthcare disclaimers (⚠️ warnings)
- ✅ Appropriate length (100-1000 characters)
- ✅ Context-specific content matching user query
- ✅ Safety considerations and professional consultation advice

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests Only
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_response_quality.py -v
```

### With Coverage Report
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_response_quality.py -v --cov=models/healthcare-ai/src --cov-report=html
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_ml_classification_accuracy.py -v
```

### E2E Tests (requires service running)
```bash
# Start service first
docker compose up -d healthcare-ai

# Run E2E tests
pytest tests/e2e/test_response_quality_validation.py -v
```

### All Tests
```bash
pytest tests/ -v --cov=models/healthcare-ai/src
```

## Test Coverage Goals
- **Target**: 80%+ coverage for critical components
- **Current**: 82% for `healthcare_trained_engine.py`
- **Focus Areas**:
