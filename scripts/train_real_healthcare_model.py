        "Safe walking requires: proper footwear with non-slip soles, clearing pathways of obstacles, adequate lighting especially at night, using handrails on stairs, and considering a mobility aid evaluation. An occupational therapist can assess your specific needs.",
        "Balance exercises that help: heel-to-toe walking, standing on one foot (near support), gentle tai chi movements, seated leg lifts, and ankle pumps. Start with 5-10 minutes daily, always near sturdy support.",
