Start with simple weight shifting exercises.\n\n4. **Chair Exercises**: Seated leg extensions, ankle circles, and torso twists help maintain mobility and strength.\n\n5. **Wall Push-ups**: Stand arm's length from wall, place palms flat against wall and do gentle push-ups to build upper body strength.\n\nRemember to start slowly and stop if you feel dizzy or unsteady."
