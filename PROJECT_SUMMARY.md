## Technical Implementation

### Response Quality Standards
All responses include:
- ✅ Numbered, actionable steps
- ✅ Professional healthcare disclaimers (⚠️)
- ✅ Specific, contextual advice matching user queries
- ✅ Safety considerations and professional guidance
- ✅ Crisis intervention protocols when needed

### Example Response Quality
**Input**: "My elderly father has trouble getting out of bed in the morning"

**Output**:
```json
{
  "response": "For helping an elderly parent with bed mobility: 1) Install bed rails for grip support, 2) Raise bed height to ease standing, 3) Use a bed assist handle, 4) Place a firm pillow behind back for leverage, 5) Consider a transfer pole for stability. Physical therapy can teach safe transfer techniques. ⚠️ Consult healthcare providers for personalized mobility assessments.",
  "category": "contextual_override",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "method": "contextual_analysis",
  "generation_time": 0.0003
}
```
