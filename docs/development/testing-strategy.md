# Healthcare AI Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Healthcare AI platform, ensuring response quality, classification accuracy, and safety compliance.

## Testing Architecture

### Test Pyramid
```
    ┌─────────────┐
    │  E2E Tests  │  (Complete system workflows)
    └─────────────┘
       ┌─────────────────┐
       │ Integration Tests │  (ML model accuracy, response quality)
       └─────────────────┘
          ┌─────────────────────┐
          │    Unit Tests       │  (Component functionality)
          └─────────────────────┘
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
**Coverage Target**: 80%+

- **Contextual Override Tests**: Verify specific healthcare scenarios trigger appropriate responses
- **ML Classification Tests**: Validate machine learning model behavior
- **Response Selection Tests**: Ensure keyword matching and scoring work correctly
- **Crisis Detection Tests**: Confirm emergency situations are handled properly
- **Response Caching Tests**: Validate performance optimization
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test edge cases and error scenarios
- **Response Formatting Tests**: Ensure proper structure and safety warnings

**Example Test**:
```python
def test_contextual_override_bed_mobility(self, engine):
    response = engine.generate_response(
        "My elderly father has trouble getting out of bed"
    )
    assert response['method'] == 'contextual_analysis'
    assert "bed rails" in response['response']
```

### 2. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
**Focus**: Real ML model performance and response quality

- **Classification Accuracy**: Test model predictions across all 11 healthcare categories
- **Response Quality Metrics**: Validate length, actionability, and specificity
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Ensure response times <100ms
- **Cache Effectiveness**: Measure performance improvements

**Key Metrics**:
- Classification accuracy across categories
- Response relevance scoring
- Generation time monitoring
- Memory usage tracking

### 3. End-to-End Tests (`tests/e2e/`)
**Focus**: Complete system validation

- **HTTP API Testing**: Full request/response cycle validation
- **Service Health Checks**: Verify all components are operational
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: Test system under load
- **Healthcare Standards Compliance**: Ensure professional quality

**Test Scenarios**:
- Complete contextual override workflows via API
- Crisis detection end-to-end
- Response caching behavior
- Error handling and recovery

## Quality Standards

### Response Quality Criteria
All responses must include:
- ✅ Numbered, actionable steps
- ✅ Professional healthcare disclaimers (⚠️)
- ✅ Specific, contextual advice
- ✅ Safety considerations
- ✅ Professional consultation recommendations

### Safety Testing
- **Crisis Detection**: Immediate identification of suicide/self-harm mentions
- **Emergency Resources**: 988 crisis line and emergency contacts
- **Medical Disclaimers**: Appropriate warnings on all health advice
- **Professional Boundaries**: Clear guidance to consult healthcare providers

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: <100ms for cached responses, <500ms for new queries
- **Accuracy**: 80%+ classification accuracy across categories
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime requirement
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 100+ simultaneous connections

## Test Data Management

### Synthetic Data
- Generated healthcare scenarios for training
- Diverse query patterns across all categories
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
