## 🚀 Core Services

### 1. Model Registry 2.0
**Universal Model Management Platform**

The Model Registry serves as the central hub for all machine learning models, providing:

- **Framework Agnostic**: Support for sklearn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, and more
- **Lifecycle Management**: Track models from development through production
- **Rich Metadata**: Store hyperparameters, metrics, lineage, and artifacts
- **Version Control**: Complete history of model iterations
- **Integration Ready**: APIs for CI/CD pipeline integration

**Key Features:**
```python
# Register a model
model = registry.register_model(
    name="healthcare-classifier",
    framework="sklearn",
    metrics={"accuracy": 0.95, "f1": 0.93},
    artifacts=["model.pkl", "preprocessor.pkl"]
)

# Promote to production
registry.promote_model(model.id, stage="production")
```

### 2. Pipeline Orchestrator 2.0
**Intelligent Workflow Automation Engine**

The Pipeline Orchestrator manages complex ML workflows with:

- **DAG-based Workflows**: Define dependencies and parallel execution
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent CPU/GPU allocation
- **ML-Specific Operators**: Pre-built tasks for common ML operations
- **Fault Tolerance**: Retry policies and failure recovery
- **Monitoring**: Real-time pipeline execution tracking

**Key Features:**
```python
# Define ML pipeline
pipeline = {
    "name": "healthcare-ml-pipeline",
    "tasks": [
        {"name": "fetch-data", "operator": "data_ingestion"},
        {"name": "validate", "operator": "data_validation"},
        {"name": "train", "operator": "model_training"},
        {"name": "register", "operator": "model_registration"}
    ]
}

# Execute pipeline
orchestrator.run_pipeline(pipeline)
```

### 3. Feature Store 2.0
**Real-time Feature Management Platform**

The Feature Store provides centralized feature management with:

- **Dual Storage**: Offline store for training, online store for serving
- **Point-in-Time Correctness**: Prevent data leakage
- **Low Latency Serving**: <10ms feature retrieval
- **Feature Versioning**: Track feature evolution
- **Monitoring**: Feature quality and usage metrics

**Key Features:**
```python
# Define features
feature_store.create_feature_set(
    name="patient_features",
    features=["age", "visit_count", "risk_score"]
)

# Serve features online
features = feature_store.get_online_features(
    entities={"patient_id": "12345"},
    features=["age", "risk_score"]
)
```

### 1. Automated Model Training
```python
# Weekly retraining pipeline
@orchestrator.schedule("0 0 * * 0")  # Every Sunday
def weekly_retraining():
    # Get latest features
    features = feature_store.get_training_data(
        feature_set="patient_features",
        start_date=last_week()
    )
    
    # Train model
    model = train_model(features)
    
    # Register if improved
    if model.metrics["accuracy"] > current_model.metrics["accuracy"]:
        registry.register_model(model)
        registry.promote_model(model.id, "production")
```

### 2. A/B Testing Models
```python
# Deploy multiple model versions
models = {
    "control": registry.get_model("healthcare-v1", stage="production"),
    "treatment": registry.get_model("healthcare-v2", stage="staging")
}

# Route traffic
def predict(request):
    if request.user_id % 100 < 10:  # 10% to treatment
        model = models["treatment"]
    else:
        model = models["control"]
    
    features = feature_store.get_online_features(request.entity_id)
    return model.predict(features)
```

### 3. Feature Engineering Pipeline
```python
# Automated feature computation
pipeline = orchestrator.create_pipeline([
    {
        "name": "compute-aggregates",
        "operator": "sql_query",
        "query": """
            SELECT patient_id,
                   COUNT(*) as visit_count_30d,
                   AVG(wait_time) as avg_wait_time
            FROM visits
            WHERE visit_date > CURRENT_DATE - 30
            GROUP BY patient_id
        """
    },
