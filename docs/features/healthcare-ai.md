## Contextual Override System

The contextual override system provides specific, actionable responses for common healthcare scenarios that require detailed guidance.

### Key Scenarios

#### Elderly Mobility Assistance
```python
# Example triggers:
"trouble getting out of bed"
"help with walking"
"balance problems"
"fall prevention"

# Response includes:
- Step-by-step mobility techniques
- Safety equipment recommendations
- Professional consultation advice
- Emergency prevention tips
```

#### Medication Management
```python
# Example triggers:
"forgot to take medication"
"pill organization"
"medication reminders"
"side effects"

# Response includes:
- Medication safety protocols
- Organization systems (pill boxes, apps)
- Reminder strategies
- When to contact healthcare providers
```

#### Caregiver Support
```python
# Example triggers:
"caregiver burnout"
"feeling overwhelmed"
"need respite care"
"caregiver stress"

# Response includes:
- Stress management techniques
- Respite care resources
- Support group information
- Self-care strategies
```

### Implementation

The contextual override system uses pattern matching and keyword detection:

```python
def _check_specific_scenarios(self, query: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Check for specific healthcare scenarios requiring contextual responses."""
    
    # Bed mobility scenario
    if any(keyword in query.lower() for keyword in 
           ["trouble getting out of bed", "help getting up", "bed transfer"]):
        return {
            "category": "adl_mobility",
            "response": self._get_bed_mobility_response(),
            "method": "contextual_override",
            "confidence": 0.95
        }
