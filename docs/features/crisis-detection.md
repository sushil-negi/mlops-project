- Provides immediate crisis intervention resources
- Maintains >99% detection accuracy
- Responds within milliseconds of detection
- Integrates with national crisis hotlines

## Detection Algorithm

### Pattern Recognition

The system uses multi-layered detection approaches:

#### 1. Keyword Detection
```python
CRISIS_KEYWORDS = [
    # Suicide ideation
    "suicide", "kill myself", "end my life", "want to die",
    "suicidal thoughts", "take my own life", "don't want to live",
    
    # Self-harm
    "self-harm", "hurt myself", "cut myself", "harm myself",
    "cutting", "self-injury", "self-mutilation",
    
    # Crisis expressions
    "can't go on", "no point in living", "better off dead",
    "everyone would be better without me", "nothing to live for"
]
```

#### 2. Contextual Analysis
```python
def analyze_crisis_context(self, query: str) -> CrisisAnalysis:
    """Analyze query context for crisis indicators."""
    
    # Check for negation patterns
    if self._has_negation(query):
        return CrisisAnalysis(level="low", confidence=0.3)
    
    # Check for immediate danger
    if self._has_immediate_intent(query):
        return CrisisAnalysis(level="critical", confidence=0.95)
    
    # Check for help-seeking behavior
    if self._has_help_seeking(query):
        return CrisisAnalysis(level="moderate", confidence=0.7)
```

#### 3. Sentiment Analysis
```python
def assess_crisis_sentiment(self, query: str) -> float:
    """Assess emotional distress level in query."""
    
    distress_indicators = [
        "hopeless", "worthless", "trapped", "burden",
        "overwhelmed", "desperate", "alone", "empty"
    ]
    
    sentiment_score = self.sentiment_analyzer.analyze(query)
    distress_level = sum(1 for word in distress_indicators 
                        if word in query.lower())
    
    return min(sentiment_score * distress_level, 1.0)
```

### Detection Levels

#### Critical (Immediate Intervention)
- Direct suicide statements ("I want to kill myself")
- Immediate self-harm intentions ("I'm going to hurt myself")
- Active crisis expressions ("I can't take this anymore")

#### High (Urgent Response)
- Suicidal ideation ("thoughts of suicide")
- Self-harm references ("I want to cut myself")
- Severe distress ("I have nothing to live for")

#### Moderate (Supportive Response)
- Mental health struggles with crisis elements
- Help-seeking with distress indicators
- Emotional crisis without immediate danger

#### Low (Monitoring)
- General mental health concerns
- Historical crisis references
- Supportive conversation about mental health

## Crisis Response Protocol

### Immediate Response (Critical/High)

When crisis is detected, the system immediately provides:

```python
def generate_crisis_response(self, crisis_level: str) -> str:
    """Generate immediate crisis intervention response."""
    
    if crisis_level in ["critical", "high"]:
        return """

        # Direct suicide statements
        ("I want to kill myself", "critical"),
        ("I'm going to end my life", "critical"),
        
        # Self-harm intentions
        ("I want to cut myself", "high"),
        ("I'm going to hurt myself", "high"),
        
        # Crisis expressions
        ("I can't go on anymore", "moderate"),
        ("There's no point in living", "moderate"),
        
        # Non-crisis statements
        ("I'm feeling sad today", "low"),
        ("I had thoughts yesterday but I'm okay", "low")
    ]
    
    for query, expected_level in test_cases:
        result = crisis_detector.detect(query)
        assert result.level == expected_level
```

#### Manual Validation

  reporting:
    clinical_review: "monthly"
    metrics_report: "weekly"
    accuracy_audit: "quarterly"
```

## Integration with Healthcare AI

### Workflow Integration

```python
def process_healthcare_query(self, query: str) -> Response:
    """Process query with crisis detection integration."""
    
    # Step 1: Crisis detection (highest priority)
    crisis_result = self.crisis_detector.detect(query)
    
    if crisis_result.level in ["critical", "high"]:
        return self.generate_crisis_response(crisis_result)
    
    # Step 2: Normal healthcare processing
    healthcare_response = self.healthcare_engine.process(query)
    
    # Step 3: Include crisis resources if moderate risk
    if crisis_result.level == "moderate":
        healthcare_response.add_crisis_resources()
    
    return healthcare_response
```

### Response Enhancement

For moderate-risk situations, the system enhances normal healthcare responses with crisis resources:

```python
def enhance_with_crisis_resources(self, response: str) -> str:
    """Add crisis resources to healthcare responses."""
    
    crisis_addition = """
    
üÜò **Additional Support Available**:
If you're experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide:
‚Ä¢ Call 988 for immediate crisis support
‚Ä¢ Text HOME to 741741 for crisis text support
‚Ä¢ Remember: You are not alone, and help is available 24/7
    """
    
    return response + crisis_addition
```

## Compliance and Legal Considerations

### Regulatory Compliance

- Complies with mental health emergency protocols
- Follows crisis intervention best practices
- Maintains documentation for liability protection

### Disclaimer Requirements
All crisis responses include appropriate disclaimers:
- Not a substitute for professional crisis intervention
- Recommendation to contact emergency services
- Limitation of AI system capabilities
- Direction to qualified mental health professionals

### Audit and Documentation
- Complete logs of all crisis detections
- Response time tracking for emergency situations
- Clinical review documentation
- Regular accuracy and effectiveness audits

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

   - Context-aware risk assessment
   - Multi-turn conversation crisis tracking

2. **Enhanced Resources**
   - Location-based crisis center referrals
   - Integration with local emergency services
   - Real-time crisis counselor availability

3. **Personalization**
   - Risk factor consideration (age, gender, history)
   - Culturally appropriate crisis resources
   - Language-specific crisis support

4. **Integration**
   - Electronic health record crisis flags
   - Care provider notification systems
   - Follow-up care coordination
