## 🚨 Critical Path Items

### Immediate Blockers (Must Fix Now)
1. **Deploy MLOps Core Services**
   - MLflow, MinIO, PostgreSQL, Redis
   - Without these, no model lifecycle management possible
   
2. **Connect Services to Monitoring**
   - Healthcare metrics exporter can't find services
   - Prometheus targets misconfigured

3. **Deploy Model Registry & Pipeline Orchestrator**
   - Services built but not operational
   - Critical for Story 8.4 and 8.5

### High Priority Gaps
1. **Story 8.4: Model Registry Enhancement** - Blocked by MLflow
2. **Story 8.5: Data Pipeline Automation** - Blocked by infrastructure
3. **Story 11.3: Feature Store** - Service exists but not deployed

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Deploy Core MLOps Services (Week 1)
```bash
# 1. Deploy MLOps core services
make deploy-mlops-core  # MLflow, MinIO, PostgreSQL, Redis

# 2. Deploy MLOps platform services  
make deploy-mlops-services  # Model Registry, Pipeline Orchestrator, Feature Store

# 3. Fix service discovery
# Update docker-compose.yml to connect services
# Configure Kubernetes service mesh for inter-service communication
```

### Phase 2: Complete Story 8.4 - Model Registry (Week 2)
- Deploy Model Registry 2.0 service
- Integrate with MLflow backend
- Implement model lineage tracking
- Add A/B testing capabilities

### Phase 3: Implement Story 8.5 - Data Pipeline (Weeks 3-4)
- Deploy Feature Store service
- Implement data collection from production
- Add automated labeling system
- Create continuous learning pipeline

### Phase 4: Complete Monitoring Integration (Week 5)
- Fix healthcare metrics exporter connections
- Add MLflow metrics to Prometheus
- Create model performance dashboards
- Implement drift detection alerts

## 📋 Backlog Recommendations

### Add Missing Stories
1. **Story 0.0: Deploy Core MLOps Infrastructure**
   - Priority: CRITICAL
   - Deploy all missing services
   - Fix service discovery issues

2. **Story 11.4: Service Mesh Implementation**
   - Add Istio/Linkerd for service communication
   - Enable secure inter-service communication
   - Add traffic management capabilities

3. **Story 8.7: Disaster Recovery & Backup**
   - Implement backup strategies for models
   - Add disaster recovery procedures
   - Create rollback mechanisms

### Update Existing Stories
1. **Story 8.4**: Add prerequisite - "Requires MLflow deployment"
2. **Story 8.5**: Add prerequisite - "Requires Feature Store deployment"
3. **Story 11.3**: Change status to "BLOCKED - awaiting deployment"

### Reprioritize Based on Dependencies
1. **Immediate**: Deploy core infrastructure (new Story 0.0)
2. **Next**: Complete blocked MLOps stories (8.4, 8.5)
3. **Then**: Healthcare features requiring ML infrastructure

## 🎯 Success Metrics Update

### Current State
- ✅ Crisis Detection: >99% (target met)
- ✅ Response Time: <500ms (target met)
- ✅ Medical Disclaimers: 85.7% (exceeds 80% target)
- ❌ Model Versioning: Not available (MLflow down)
- ❌ Deployment Frequency: Manual only (pipeline incomplete)
- ❌ Data Pipeline: No automation (services missing)

### 30-Day Targets
1. All MLOps services deployed and operational
2. Automated model training pipeline functional
3. A/B testing capability demonstrated
4. Data collection pipeline operational
5. Model registry with 3+ model versions

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Risks

### High Risk Items
1. **No Model Versioning**: Can't track or rollback models
2. **No Feature Store**: Can't ensure training/serving consistency
3. **Manual Deployments**: Despite GitOps setup, model updates manual
4. **No Data Pipeline**: Can't collect production data for retraining

### Medium Risk Items
1. Service discovery issues between components
2. Monitoring can't track ML-specific metrics
3. No automated retraining triggers
4. Limited disaster recovery capabilities

## 📊 Resource Requirements

### Immediate Needs
1. **DevOps Engineer**: Deploy and configure services (1 week)
2. **MLOps Engineer**: Connect services and fix pipelines (2 weeks)
3. **Infrastructure**: Expanded Kubernetes resources for services

### Ongoing Needs
1. **MLOps Engineer**: Full-time for pipeline maintenance
2. **Data Engineer**: Part-time for data pipeline development
3. **Compliance Specialist**: HIPAA certification preparation

## Conclusion

While significant progress has been made on monitoring and the healthcare AI application, the MLOps platform is incomplete without core services. The immediate priority must be deploying MLflow, MinIO, PostgreSQL, and Redis to enable model lifecycle management. Without these, the platform cannot scale or maintain models effectively in production.
